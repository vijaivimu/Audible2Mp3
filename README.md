## 🏃 Why I Built This

As someone who loves listening to audiobooks while running, I found that my Garmin running watch doesn’t support Audible’s `.aax` format. I needed a lightweight way to convert my audiobooks to `.mp3` so I could load them onto my watch and enjoy them during long runs.

So I built this tool — and it solved my problem perfectly.
